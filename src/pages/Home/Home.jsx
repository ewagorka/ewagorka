              As Head of Product at Revolancer, I spearheaded strategic planning and user-centric UI/UX design, and was in charge of the brandâ€™s development. By integrating comprehensive user research and data analytics, I continually enhanced our product offerings. Additionally, I managed various projects, leading cross-functional teams and orchestrating platform overhauls that accelerated user growth.
              <br /><br />
              My leadership played a pivotal role in scaling Revolancer from 200 to over 140,000 users and securing significant funding, establishing us as an industry leader featured in Forbes and Business Insider.

              I hold an A+ grade in Front End Web Development and UX Programme from the University of Birmingham, where I received The Anna Lebiedziewicz Outstanding Student Award. Prior to this, I achieved a First-Class Honours Degree in BSc Computer Science from Aberystwyth University, where I developed innovative projects like a Python web app using AI face recognition and OpenGL.
              <br /><br />
              Outside of work, I'm passionate about interior design and architecture, often exploring charity shops for unique finds. I also enjoy diverse creative and problem-solving games, from tabletop RPGs to Sudoku.
